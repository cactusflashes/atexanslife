                Beginning in 1962, Juan joined the US Navy Reserves while still in his junior year of highschool.
                During this time, he would commute between Douglas and Long Beach, California for basic training.

                Shortly prior to his graduation, Juan and Virginia, who had been dating for a few years prior, 
                made the decision to get engaged. Juan sold his Fender Stratocaster guitar to pay for their engagement ring.

                Juan and Virginia married on January 30th, 1965. Directly after their ceremony, they headed to Long Beach 
                by bus to begin the next part of their lives together.

                After moving to Long Beach, Juan was stationed aboard the USS Kearsarge (CVS-33), an aircraft carrier that the Navy
                converted into an anti-submarine warfare carrier, or ASW carrier. The Kearsarge embarked on several journies 
                during the Vietnam and Korean war, including areas of the South China Sea, Hawaii, Japan, and Malaysia.

                Aboard the Kearsarge, Juan worked manning the phones to identify and report damage that was caused by
                the possibility of an attack from enemy weapons. Juan's final position in the Navy was as a Yeoman 
                Third Class, assisting with administrative duties aboard the ship. 
            </p>
            <p>
                During his time in the Navy, Juan's first daughter Barbara (Barbie) was born on November 8th, 1965. Not long after, 
                Juan was honorably dischared from the Navy, and began looking around 
                California for work—eventually finding a job at an aluminum factory in Torrence, California.

            <p>
                After working at the aluminium factory for a period of time, Juan and Virginia grew homesick and made the 
                decision to move back to Douglas, Arizona. They arrived back in Douglas in October of 1967. Immediately after, 
                Juan accepted a job working for the City Loan & Finance Company. He began as a collector, eventually moving into 
                the position of Loan Officer. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In 1969, Juan was hired at Valley National Bank, assuming the role of Collector, then Loan Officer, 
                and eventually Manager of the loan department. Juan oversaw ten employees, and was responsible for 
                a loan portfolio of over 12 million dollars. 
            </p>
            <p>
                On September 22, 1968, Juan and Virginia's second child, Christy was born, followed by Johnny in 1975.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 1989, Valley National Bank merged with a Chicago-based bank, and laid off a large percentage of the 
                workforce, including Juan. Juan looked for work in Douglas, Sierra Vista, and Tucson. Eventually, Juan was
                hired at the Arizona-Mexico Border Health Foundation, where he worked to educate young adults on the 
                consequences of drugs, alcohol, and tobacco. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Juan would chaperone children between the ages of eight and twelve, taking them fishing while educating them on the harmful effects
                of drugs along the way. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In October of 1997, Juan was hired as a manager and loan officer at Southeastern Arizona Federal Credit Union, where
                he remained until his retirement.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Shortly before his retirement from the credit union, Juan formed a band with a group of friends, known
                as "Blind Dawg".

                Juan was also a member of the Noon Lions Club for over 40 years, helping raise money and 
                assisting those needing eye exams and glasses, as well as donating money to children's programs, sports, 
                scholarships, and other areas of the Douglas community.
