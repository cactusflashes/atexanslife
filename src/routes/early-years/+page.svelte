                In his youth, Juan grew up playing with neighborhood friends and working miscellaneous 
                jobs in and around Texas, including traversing the state picking cotton or tomatoes as young
                as four years old.

                <em>Brownsville was experiencing an agricultural boom during this time, at one point even

                In 1957, Juan's father recieved a letter from his brother Tony, who had returned from the Army and headed south to find work. 
                Tony found work as a construction union president in Douglas, Arizona. With the prospect of 
                better work on the horizon, Juan's parents made the decision to relocate.

                In September of 1957, Juan & his family reloacted to Douglas, Arizona. Not long after, Juan met his 
                life-long friend Joe Duarte, bonding over guitar and wrestling.

                Also during this time, Juan & friends formed a band known as '<strong>The Krystals</strong>'. 
                The group played rock & roll, corridos, and boledos. 
                With Juan heading up the rhythm guitar, his first composed instrumental
                for the band was entitled '<strong>Ginny</strong>'.

                The band played gigs around town consisting of weddings, parties, and quinceañeras. In 1963, the band was invited to 
                perform at a regional talent show for the local radio station and won second place with their song 
                'Underwater' broadcasted to Douglas & surrounding municipalities.
