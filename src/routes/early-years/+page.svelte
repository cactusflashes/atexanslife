            Juan was born in Brownsville, Texas on March 25th, 1945 to Juan and
            Margarita Perez. Juan's birth fell directly between two major 20th
            century generations—The Silent Generation & The Baby Boomer
            Generation.

            In his youth, Juan grew up playing with neighborhood friends and
            working miscellaneous jobs in and around Texas, including traversing
            the state picking cotton or tomatoes as young as four years old.

                Brownsville was experiencing an agricultural boom during this
                time, at one point even becoming the world's leading exporter of
                cotton in the 1950's for a brief stint.

            In 1957, Juan's father recieved a letter from his brother Tony, who
            had returned from the Army and headed south to find work. Tony found
            work as a construction union president in Douglas, Arizona. With the
            prospect of better work on the horizon, Juan's parents made the
            decision to relocate.

        <p>
            Juan's parents had previously lived in Pirtleville, Arizona for a
            brief period in 1944 before Juan's birth. During this time, Juan's
            father worked laying railroad tracks.

            In September of 1957, Juan & his family reloacted to Douglas,
            Arizona. Not long after, Juan met his life-long friend Joe Duarte,
            bonding over guitar and wrestling.

            Also during this time, Juan & friends formed a band known as 'The
            Krystals'. The group played rock & roll, corridos, and boledos. With
            Juan heading up the rhythm guitar, his first composed instrumental
            for the band was entitled 'Ginny'.
